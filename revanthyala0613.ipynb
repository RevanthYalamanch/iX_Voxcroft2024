Two weeks of fighting last month in and around al-Fasher has killed more than 120 people.\\nMeanwhile, the military has allied itself with rebel groups and formed a joint force to retain control of the city, where hundreds of thousands of displaced people have taken shelter since the conflict began.\\n\\u201cIt is outrageous that the RSF opened fire inside the hospital. This is not an isolated incident, as staff and patients have endured attacks on the facility for weeks from all sides, but opening fire inside a hospital crosses a line,\\u201d said Michel Lacharite, head of emergency operations at Doctors Without Borders.\\nAt the time of the attack, there were 10 patients and a reduced medical crew as the aid group and the Sudanese health ministry had begun evacuating patients and transferring medical services last week to other facilities, the aid group said.\\nMost patients and the medical team, including Doctors Without Borders staff, managed to flee the shooting. It was not immediately clear whether there were casualties from the attack, according to the aid group.\\nA spokesman for the RSF didn\\u2019t return phone calls seeking comment.\\nThe facility had been hit by mortar shells and bullets three times between May 25 and June 3, killing two people and wounding 14 patients, Doctors Without Borders said.\\nSudan\\u2019s conflict began in April last year when soaring tensions between the leaders of the military and the RSF exploded into open fighting in the capital, Khartoum and elsewhere in the country.\\nThe war has wrecked Sudan, killing more than 14,000 people and wounding thousands others, while pushing its population to the brink of famine. The U.N. food agency warned the warring parties last month that there is a serious risk of widespread starvation and death in Darfur and elsewhere in Sudan if they don\\u2019t allow humanitarian aid into the vast western region.\\nWidespread sexual violence and other atrocities from both sides have also been reported, amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity, according to the United Nations.\\nTwo decades ago, the RSF was born out of Arab militias, commonly known as Janjaweed, mobilized by former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir against populations that identify as Central or East African in Darfur. At the time, they were accused of mass killings, rapes and other atrocities, and Darfur became synonymous with genocide.\\nJanjaweed groups still aid the RSF.\\nAP\",\n          \"A woman who got married to her deceased husband while he was still married to his first wife failed to convince the Namibian Supreme Court that her marriage was legal.\\nThe woman approached the Supreme Court after the High Court dismissed her application to have her marriage with the deceased declared putative.\\nAnastasia Amunyela and the late Phillip Amunyela met in March 1995 while she was pursuing her studies in London.\\nAccording to Anastasia, Amunyela told her that he was separated from his previous wife and he left her with their children in their marital home. He said the separation happened before his move to London.\\nA year later in August 1996, the couple got married while they were still both in London.\\nAmunyela passed away in Namibia without a will in November 2014. They had one boy during their time as a couple.\\nAnastasia was subsequently the executrix of Amunyela\\u2019s estate.\\nHowever, she experienced challenges with the administration of the estate, and appointed a legal representative to assist her with the process.\\nShe was told that the property in Windhoek, which was the major asset in the estate, 50% of it belonged to Amunyela\\u2019s children from his previous marriage, and she needed their consent to buy it from them.\\nShe sent them a consent form which provided that they should consent to selling her 50% of the property for the amount of R3.1 million.\\nAmunyela\\u2019s children refused to sign the consent forms. Instead, they had their legal representative write to Anastasia\\u2019s legal representative, stating that, in order to consider the sale and grant consent, among other requirements, they wanted copies of letters appointing her as the executrix of the estate, a valuation of the property, and a draft deed of sale.\\nThey further wanted to know whether she and Amunyela remarried after their father divorced with their mother.\\nAccording to Anastasia, that\\u2019s when she was told by her lawyer that Amunyela actually got divorced three years after their marriage and this rendered their marriage null and void.\\nIn court, Anastasia said she was not aware that Amunyela was still married to his ex-wife when they got married.\\nTo support her argument, she stated that she and Amunyela regarded their marriage to be in community of property and lawful.\\nShe asked the court to declare her marriage legal and be in community of property as she was entitled to Amunyela\\u2019s half share of the estate.\\nShe further added that not declaring the marriage putative would prejudice her because she purchased the property in 2001 after renting it for some time from the government, and she was the exclusive owner of the property according to the deed of transfer.\\nResponding Anastasia\\u2019s assertions, Amunyela\\u2019s children denied that the marriage between her and their father was legal.\\nAccording to them, she knew that their father was not divorced at the time she married him and if she wasn\\u2019t, she definently became aware in 2006.\\nThe children argued that in 2006, their mother purchased their father\\u2019s share of the marital home. In the paperwork, it was stated that the couple divorced in 1999, and Anastasia initialed each page when she signed as a witness, so she must have seen the year of the divorce in the documents.\\nIn response, she said did not scrutinise the contents of the documents when she was signing and asked the court not to rely on her signature because she did not read the documents.\\nFurthermore, the children said they found it unlikely that she was not aware of the fact that their father was convicted and sentenced for bigamy in the year 2000.\\nShe had no explanation to how she could not have become aware of his conviction of bigamy.\\nTo strengthen their argument, they said her son\\u2019s birth certificate, who is their half brother, indicated that she was not married to Amunyela.\\nIn her defence, she said she had not used the birth certificate before, therefore did not notice the error. She corrected the error after she noticed it and blamed the error on Home Affairs.\\nThe appeal court said whether the mistakes in the birth certificates are attributable to the Home Affairs, it was very unlikely that she had not seen or used her son\\u2019s full birth certificate.\\nIt was further held that it was highly unlikely that Amunyela would have been convicted of bigamy without it coming to her attention because she claimed that they were close and did everything together as a couple.\\n\\u201cAppellant (Anastasia) failed to convince us that while she might not have known at the time of her marriage to the deceased that he was still married to his ex-wife, she learnt of the defect in her marriage long before deceased died,\\u201d read the judgment.\\nThe Supreme Court upheld the high court\\u2019s decision and dismissed her application.\\n-IOL News\\nIn other news \\u2013 VIDEO: Skhothane Sa Pitori apologizes for Shebeshxt death hoax\\nControversial Mzansi rapper, Shebeshxt became a victim of a death hoax after Skhothane Sa Pitori announced to event attendees that the rap sensation had died in a car accident he was involved in.\\nAfter a video of his announcement resurfaced on social media Skhothane Sa Pitori issued an apology and wished Shebeshxt a speedy recovery. \\u201cI\\u2019d like to ask for forgiveness, there was a misunderstanding at a gig that took place yesterday.
